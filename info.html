<p class="first">Born in Rimini (Italy), Lucia Masi is an artist and designer based in London since 2015. Her work focuses on the love for organic shapes and colours found in nature, from which she draws inspiration and uses across all her mediums of work. With a keen eye for the perfect colour on the canvas, her paintings are a majestic flow of hues, which accompanied by her unique amorphous shapes, produce an iconic style, recognisable anywhere without context. The same philosophy carries onto her sculptures, where she creates objects that suck the viewer in from every angle, defying any sense of logic and space.<br><br>With a background as a fashion designer, Lucia’s work extends to the fields of design and most recently textile. She uses an innovative approach by bringing her complex knowledge of fabric and materials over to her pieces by, for example, making use of the technique of stitching onto acrylic sheets.<br><br>Influenced by her daily life, hobbies and favourite artists like Georgia O'Keeffe and Dora Maurer, her art continues to evolve and diverse through the passing of time
