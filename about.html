Born in Rimini (Italy), Lucia Masi is an artist and designer based in London. Lucia's experimental work applies an innovative approach, made possible by the adaptation of modern technology, for the purpose of exploring new techniques and the creation of an ever-evolving body of work.

Having both depth and simplicity, Lucia's work defies the conventional rules of creation, constructing an alternate reality through the process of modifying nature's original form.
She raises the question about how everything can become otherworldly and timeless when given a new state of matter.

Every artwork has the means to transform its location. The visual interactiveness and the unorthodox reality of each work innately reunites audiences and inspires an unusual sense of connection to our planet. The practice's aim is to constantly find a solution to be as sustainable as possible.
